Assign splits to each feature based on feature importance
sample from the splits where distribution is softmax on feature importance
build histogram on that sample and train an estimator

now for federated:
obtain and aggregate feature importances and assign splits per feature (acc to categorization, obtain that too)
get feature splits based on that from each client and aggregate them based on client sample sizes
*check if gain values in feature importances depends upon sample size*
